Profile: OnconovaPrimaryCancerCondition
Id: onconova-primary-cancer-condition
Title: "Primary Cancer Condition Profile"
Parent: PrimaryCancerCondition
Description: """
A profile that records the primary cancer condition, the original or first neoplasm in the body (Definition from: [NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms](https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms/def/primary-tumor)). Cancers that are not clearly secondary (i.e., of uncertain origin or behavior) should be documented as primary.

It constrains the mCODE [PrimaryCancerCondition profile](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/StructureDefinition/mcode-primary-cancer-condition) to constrain the terminologies of the cancer topography and morphology extensions to use exclusively ICD-O-3 codes.

This profile can be used to represent the Onconova neoplastic entities of relationship `primary`, `local_recurrence`, and `regional_recurrence`. Local and regional recurrences are indicated using extensions to denote that the condition is a recurrence of a previous condition, and to specify the type of recurrence (local or regional). For example, a local recurrence would be represented as a PrimaryCancerCondition with:
```
{
    clinicalStatus: {
        coding: [
            {
                system: "http://snomed.info/sct",
                code: "recurrence",
                display: "Recurrence"
            }
        ],
    },
    _clinicalStatus {
        extension: [
            {
                url: "http://onconova.github.io/fhir/StructureDefinition/onconova-ext-recurrence-type",
                valueCodeableConcept: {
                    coding: [
                        {
                            system: "http://snomed.info/sct",
                            code: "255470001",
                            display: "Local (qualifier value)"
                        }
                    ]
                }
            }
        ]
    },
}
