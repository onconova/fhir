It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '3.0.0', found versions: 2.1.0 (from hl7.terminology.r4#5.0.0), 3.0.0 (from hl7.terminology.r4#7.0.1). Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/v3-ObservationInterpretation|3.0.0' (INVALID)
